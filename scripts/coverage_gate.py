"""Fail if any single integration module is below the coverage floor.

--cov-fail-under checks the total, which is exactly the number that hides the
problem: one module can rot to nothing while the average stays comfortable,
and the quality-scale rule this repo claims to meet asks for the figure per
module rather than overall. So the aggregate gate stays and this runs after
it, against the same run's JSON report.
